                <p class="lead">For our third year group project we had to develop an autonomous snack delivery robot which woud operate inside Imperial College's EEE Building. The specifications required the robot to start in the Robotics Lab on the 5th floor, take an order from the user, autonomously navigate to the lift, take the lift to the 2nd floor where the cafe is located, place and collect the order, and deliver it back to the user on the 5th floor. All this was to be achieved while giving safety a very high priority. All of the software was developed to be integrated the Robot Intelligence Lab's <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/robot-intelligence/robots/robot_de_niro/" target="_blank">Robot DE NIRO</a>.</p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Implementation</h2>
                <p class="lead">The operation of the robot within the EEE building was divided into 5 main parts: Safety, Mapping, Navigation, Lift Operation and Verbal I/O. Safety was a very important part of our project considering that the weighed around 200 Kgs, collisons or other kinds of accidents involving people could lead to a severe injury. Also as the cost of the robot was aroung GBP 50,000, we had to prevent it from getting damaged. Several methods were implemented including saftey beacons to alert nearby people, wireless control for stopping the robot remotely in case of emergency and cliff detection to avoid the robot from accidently falling down the stairs. Mapping was needed so that the robot could familiarize with environment, localise itself within building and assist in navigation. Navigation was used to make the robot autonomously navigate to a specified point in map. This was done planning an initial path avoiding static obstacles on the map and navigate in real time by using a SLAM (Simultanious Mapping And Localisation) algorithm while avoiding dynamic obstacles. Lift operation was used for all the operations reguired to function while near or on the lift. This involved using computer vision for detecting the lift buttons and the current floor, and visual servoing for pressing the required lift buttons. Lastly Verbal I/O was used to communicate with the user. Amazon Echo was used for taking commands from the user and the responce from the robot was given using speech synthesis. <a href="http://www.ros.org/" target="_blank">ROS</a> (Robot Operating System) was used for the integration and concurrent operation of all these tasks.</p>

                <p class="lead">I mainly worked on cliff detection and mapping. For cliff detection I used the point cloud from the Kinect, mounted to the robot, and the <a href="http://pointclouds.org/" target="_blank">Pointcloud Library</a> for detecting and removing the points that were part of the ground plane. These reaming 3D point cloud was down projected to 2d as that also took points below the floor, like downward stairs, into account hence recognizing the cliff as an obstacle. 3D Mapping was done using the <a href="https://octomap.github.io" target="_blank">octomap</a> framework which had an existing package for ROS (<a href="http://wiki.ros.org/octomap_server" target="_blank">octomap-server</a>). Octomap uses the octree data structure for representing space and, ray casting and probabilistic occupancy estimation for generating the map. The map genarated for the EEE Robotics Lab is given on the side and a side by side comparison with the real view is given below.</p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Outcome</h2>
                <p class="lead">This project has greatly increased my interest in robotics. It allowed be get comfortable with several programming libraries and frameworks that I had not used before like PCL which is used for manipulating point clouds, the Octomap framework used for generating maps, etc. Using ROS was also a great learning experience.</p>

                <p class="lead">For our third year High Level Programming course we had to build an ARM assembler and simulator for a subset of Cortex-M3 Instruction set. <a href="http://fsharp.org/" target="_blank">F#</a> was the high level programming language of choice for this course.</p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Implementation</h2>
                <p class="lead">We seperated the tasks of this project into 4 main categories. The Machine State which emulates all the internals of the processor like registers, memory, etc. The Execution which takes in an instruction and the current machine state, executes the instruction and returns a new state. The Parser that takes in the instructions as a string and then returns them in their respective instruction data structures. And lastly the UI which was built using HTML and FABLE which transpiles F# code into a Javascript program. Checkout our <a href="https://github.com/balassaloci/HLP_ARM_Simulator" target="_blank">github repository</a> for the complete code of the simulator.</p>

                <p class="lead">I devloped the complete machine state and the execution of all memory related instructions. I used an abstract data type (ADT) for the machine state. Several functions were written to provide a complete interface for operating the machine state like getting value from a register, writing to memory, etc. The execution of memory instructions was also done using an ADT with custom types developed for different kinds of instructions. The complete implementation can be seen in our <a href="https://github.com/balassaloci/HLP_ARM_Simulator" target="_blank">repository</a> as mentioned above.

                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Outcome</h2>
                <p class="lead">This was a very challenging project which greatly helped in improving my programming skills. I got familiar with the functional programming paradigm and was also introduced to test driven development. The project allowed me deepen my knowledge about the arm architecture. Due to the collaborative nature of the project I also got comfortable with using git and collaborating in large software projects.</p>

                <p class="lead">For our professional engineering course in the first year we had to work on one of several tasks proposed by <a href="http://www.ewbchallenge.org/nepal-water-health-newah" target="_blank">NEWAH EWB Challenge</a>. My group chose the task designing an automated data recording system to monitor the health of natural springs and waterways. The design needed a sensor that could measure the flow of water and transmit the readings to a server where they could be analyzed.</p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Design</h2>
                <p class="lead">To measure the depth of water stream we chose an ultrasonic sensor and for the speed of water we used a laser sensor. The overall flow of water can then be approximated from the the readings. These sensors were chosen as they were completely unobtrusive which was better for the environment and also extended the life of the product. The data was transmitted using a gsm antenna connected to an arduino and the whole product was powered a by solar panel and battries.</p> 
                <p class="lead">I was mainly involved in choosing the appropriates sensors and the overall design of the product.</p>
